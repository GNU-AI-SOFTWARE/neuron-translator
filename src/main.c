/** @file main.c
 *  @brief Main entry point and initialization for the translator
 *
 *  This file contains the main() function that initializes the translator
 *  and starts the Hurd trivfs server loop. It follows GNU Hurd translator
 *  conventions and provides the entry point for the system.
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: On GNU/Hurd, the main() function is NEVER called for filesystem
 *  translators. The entry point is through the trivfs interface (trivfs_demuxer).
 *  This main() function is only for non-Hurd systems (Debian/Linux) for testing
 *  and compilation verification.
